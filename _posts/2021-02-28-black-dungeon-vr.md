I built this simple game, targeting Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality headsets, using Unity and the SteamVR SDK.

✓ Developed, from the ground up, all the game mechanics and components reaching a frame rate of 90fps to avoid motion sickness.

✓ Implemented all the VR locomotion and interactions using the SteamVR Unity SDK.

✓ Enhanced the project with speech recognition functionality for providing help to the user and improving presence in VR.

✓ Added Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services and Microsoft Azure Language Understanding (LUIS).

✓ Used assets from the Unity Assets Store for the environment.

More details about the implementation and findings have also been described in this session at the [NDC London 2021 Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFY-vrZmHow). Slides are available [here](https://davide.dev/ndc-london-2021-getting-started-unity-ar-vr/).
