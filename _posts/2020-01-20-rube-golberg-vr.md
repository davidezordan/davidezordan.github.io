I built this simple game, targeting Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality headsets, using Unity and the SteamVR SDK.

The goal is to collect all the stars available in the environment with a single launch of the ball from the platform and then reach the goal target.

The user can navigate the environment using the Oculus touch controllers and teleportation using the left hand controller thumbstick. The object selection menu can be activated with the right thumbstick. Trigger controls permit to interact and interact with objects using the trigger buttons.
